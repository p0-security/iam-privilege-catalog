name: Privilege escalation
description: |
  Allows an attacker to either access an account with more
  sensitive privileges (e.g. an admin-specific account), or
  add these privileges to an account under the attacker's
  control.
risk: CRITICAL
mitigations:
  - Avoid use of admin or root accounts
  - Securely store admin and root account credentials
  - Scan for insecurely stored account credentials
  - Use ephemeral entitlement grants for sensitive operations
  - Apply permission boundaries to identity entitlements
