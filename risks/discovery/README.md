Risks that allow an attacker to describe the system under attack.

In general these risks do not directly lead to organizational impact,
but aid attackers in further penetrating the system.

An exception occurs when identifiers within the system are themselves sensitive;
e.g. labeling storage buckets with customer names will leak a commercial organization's
customer list.
