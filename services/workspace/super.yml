    notes: >-
      Super admins have the highest level of privilege in a Workspace account.

      Holding this privilege allows creation and deletion of accounts, as well as
      account takeover via password reset. It allows modification of administrator
      roles and role assignments. It also can allow disabling (or enabling) of two-
      factor security settings.
