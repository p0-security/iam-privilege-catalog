    risks:
      - impact:access
    notes: >-
      Converting a group to a security group is a one-time irreversible operation. Security
      groups can not be automatically joined by your organization's members, nor joined by
      non-security groups or users external to your organization.

      Since this is a non-reversible operation, converting a group to a security group can
      impact group access.
