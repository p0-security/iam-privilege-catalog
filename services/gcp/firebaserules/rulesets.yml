name: Firebase security rules publishing
description: >-
  Manage security rules sources. By themselves, these don't do anything, but when they are referenced by the current release, they are the active rules.
scope: HIGH
privileges:
  create:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:policy, escalation:data, impact:access]
    notes: >-
      While creating a ruleset by itself doesn't do anything, when combined with access to update security rules releases, an attacker can hijack your security rules.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:logs]
    notes: >-
      While an attacker cannot delete the currently used ruleset, they can delete older rulesets which may cause a loss of historical rules information.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:policy]
  list:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Lists metadata only.
  test:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
