description: >-
  Logging sinks control how logs are routed. They can be used to export logs to Cloud Storage,
  BigQuery, a Cloud Logging bucket, or a Pub/Sub topic.
scope: MEDIUM

  create:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]

    vulnerabilities: [destruction:defense]
    notes: >-
      Updating a log sink can update the filter used to exclude logs from being
      routed by the sink. This can impair defenses by allowing an attacker to filter 
      out their activity in the system.
