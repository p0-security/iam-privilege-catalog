name: Cloud DNS Networks
description: >-
  Resources used by Cloud DNS to bind DNS zones or policies with VPC networks.
scope: MEDIUM
privileges:
  bindDNSResponsePolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      If the network is in a private DNS zone, an attacker can change DNS 
      resolution behavior by binding a response policy. This can create a DOS.
      If the attacker additionally has permissions to create or update response policy rules,
      allows domain takeover.
  bindPrivateDNSZone:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      Binding a new private DNS zone can change DNS resolution behavior, potentially creating a DOS.
      If the attacker additionally has permissions to create or update records in any zone, allows domain takeover.
  bindPrivateDNSPolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Allows binding a server policy to a VPC network. This can create a DOS because it can disable 
      resolution with any name servers other than the ones specified in the policy.
  targetWithPeeringZone:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows you to configure a network with DNS peering, so that
      DNS requests in the network "forwarded" to the peer network. This can change DNS
      resolution behavior, which can potentially create a DOS.
      If the attacker additionally has permissions to create or update records in any zone, allows domain takeover.
  useHealthSignals:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Allows using Cloud DNS health checking on the network. 
      This is used to create routing policies that will automatically failover to healthy endpoints
      in the case of health check failures.
