name: Cloud DNS GKE Clusters
description: >-
  Resources used by Cloud DNS to bind a private DNS zone or a DNS response policy with a GKE cluster.
scope: MEDIUM
privileges:
  bindDNSResponsePolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      If the cluster is in a private DNS zone, an attacker can change DNS 
      resolution behavior by binding a response policy. This can create a DOS.
      If the attacker additionally has permissions to create or update response policy rules,
      allows domain takeover.
  bindPrivateDNSZone:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      If Cloud DNS is enabled on the cluster already, 
      binding a new private DNS zone can change DNS resolution behavior, potentially creating a DOS.
      If the attacker additionally has permissions to create or update records in any zone, allows domain takeover.
