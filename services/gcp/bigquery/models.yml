  BigQuery models allow users to build machine-learning pipelines
  within BigQuery.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Marked as HIGH (vs. CRITICAL), as the scope of data accessible via models
  is generally likely to be more limited than direct query access. This may
  underestimate scope in the event that an organization's primary function
  depends on machine learning implemented within BigQuery models.
