description: >-
  Datasets in BigQuery are a primary unit of organizing
  and controlling access to data. They are analogous to
  schemata in relational data systems.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  BigQuery can potentially store sensitive information from
  across an organization's functions.

    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. The
      vulnerabilities apply if the tag is used in any policies.

      Possibly used by the AnalyticsHub API projects.locations.dataExchanges/create, although this is
      undocumented by Google. More likely is that creating linked datasets is actually solely enabled by
      analyticshub.listings.create, and this permission is unused.
