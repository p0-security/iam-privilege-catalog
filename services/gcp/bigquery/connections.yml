  External read-only connections to data in other services (both within
  and without GCP).
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Deletion or alteration of connections can interrupt dependent
  operations. Reading connection metadata can expose database accounts.

    notes: >
      In order to exploit a connection to read data from a third-party source, all of the following must be true:
        - The attacker must have permission to create a connection of the correct type
        - The attacker must already have read access to the target data system, or have a mechanism to give
          the connection read access to the target data system
        - The attacker can then use this permission to run queries against the connection
      In general, therefore, exfiltration is only possible when the attacker already otherwise has access ot the
      target system.
