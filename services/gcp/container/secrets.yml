name: Kubernetes Engine Secrets
description: >-
  A Kubernetes Secret is mounted as a volume on Pods. Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but
  are meant for storing sensitive data.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  By default, secrets are stored unencrypted, and anyone who can read a Secret can read its contents (its `data` field).
  The Secret contents are mounted inside pods as files in the file system. Someone with ability to gain access into a Pod
  may freely read the contents of the secret.
mitigations:
  - Configure RBAC rules to limit read access to secrets
  - Configure encryption at rest for secrets
  - Use external Secret Providers

      Creating a secret does not represent a security risk by itself.

    notes: >-
      Deleting a secret may disrupt communication of workloads with the Kubernetes API server,
      or other services.

      By default, secrets are stored unencrypted in Kubernetes, and anyone who can read the secret
      has access to its contents.

      List all secrets in a specific namespace. Listing also allows reading the data field of each secret.
  update:

    notes: >-
      Allows updating the contents of the secret (the `data` field) unless `immutable` property was set to true.
