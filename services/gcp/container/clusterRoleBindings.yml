name: Kubernetes Engine ClusterRole Bindings
description: >-
  A ClusterRoleBinding is used to associate a ClusterRole with one or more principals (users, groups, or service accounts). 
  It establishes a connection between a set of permissions defined in a ClusterRole and the entities that should have those permissions.
  ClusterRoles are scoped to the entire Kubernetes cluster.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  ClusterRoles are only definitions of permissions. A role does not take effect unless
  assigned to principal via a ClusterRoleBinding.

    notes: >-
      Kubernetes does not allow the creation or update of a ClusterRoleBinding unless at least one of the following two conditions is met:
      1) the caller has the permission it is granting
      2) the caller has the `containers.clusterRoles.bind` permission

      Deleting a ClusterRoleBinding removes the permissions of the ClusterRole from a list of principals
