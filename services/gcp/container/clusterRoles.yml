name: Kubernetes Engine Roles
description: >-
  A cluster role is a set of permissions that defines a specific level of access to resources within a single namespace.
  It consists of rules that specify which API operations can be performed on specific resource types.
  ClusterRoles are scoped to the entire cluster.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  ClusterRoles are only definitions of permissions. A role does not take effect unless
  assigned to principal via a ClusterRoleBinding.
privileges:
  bind:
    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      Allows escalating the current or other users' permissions by binding a ClusterRole to them. 
      Also requires the `container.clusterRoleBindings.create` or `container.clusterRoleBindings.update` permission.

      Kubernetes does not allow the creation or update of a ClusterRole unless one of the following two conditions are met:
      1) the caller already has the permissions contained in the role
      2) the caller has the `container.clusterRoles.escalate` permission

    notes: >-
      ClusterRoles that are attached to principals via a ClusterRoleBinding can be deleted in Kubernetes.
  escalate:
    risks: [escalation:lateral, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      Allows escalating the current or other users' permissions by creating a new ClusterRole or updating an existing ClusterRole.
      Also requires the `container.clusterRoles.create` or `container.clusterRoles.update` permission.
