name: Kubernetes Engine Roles
description: >-
  A cluster role is a set of permissions that defines a specific level of access to resources within a single namespace.
  It consists of rules that specify which API operations can be performed on specific resource types.
  ClusterRoles are scoped to the entire cluster.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  ClusterRoles are only definitions of permissions. A role does not take effect unless
  assigned to principal via a ClusterRoleBinding.

  bind:
    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      Kubernetes does not allow the creation or update of a ClusterRoleBinding if that grants permissions
      the caller user does not already have. However, the `bind` permission allows this action.

    notes: >-
      ClusterRoles that are attached to principals via a ClusterRoleBinding can be deleted in Kubernetes.

    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      Allows escalating the current or other users' permissions via a ClusterRole creation or update.

    notes: >-
      Retrieves the permissions contained in a specific ClusterRole.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:policy]
    notes: >-
      List all ClusterRoles
  update:
    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      ClusterRole updates are dangerous because the updated role may already be assigned to principals,
      leading to privilege escalation. However, the Kubernetes API prevents escalating privileges of
      the current or another user via a ClusterRole creation or update, unless the user already has 
      the permission, or has the `escalate` permission.
