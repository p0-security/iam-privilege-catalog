name: Kubernetes Engine Roles
description: >-
  A role is a set of permissions that defines a specific level of access to resources within a single namespace.
  It consists of rules that specify which API operations can be performed on specific resource types.
  Roles are scoped to a specific Kubernetes namespace.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Roles are only definitions of permissions. A role does not take effect unless
  assigned to principal via a RoleBinding.

    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      Kubernetes does not allow the creation or update of a RoleBinding if that grants permissions
      the caller user does not already have. However, the `bind` permission allows this action.

      Roles that are attached to principals via a RoleBinding can be deleted in Kubernetes.

      Allows escalating the current or other users' permissions via a Role creation or update.

  update:
    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Role updates are dangerous because the updated role may already be assigned to principals,
      leading to privilege escalation. However, the Kubernetes API prevents escalating privileges of
      the current or another user via a Role creation or update, unless the user already has 
      the permission, or has the `escalate` permission.
