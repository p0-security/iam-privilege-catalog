name: Kubernetes Jobs
description: >-
  A Kubernetes Job is a type of controller that runs one or more Pods until they successfully complete, 
  by retrying (restarting) the Pods if necessary. The Pod and its resources are released when the Job completes. 
  Jobs are typically used for batch processes, report generation or maintenance tasks.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  The security implications of Jobs are similar to other controllers, like Deployments. Jobs ultimately lead to
  running a container image, and may allow arbitrary code execution in the cluster. That code runs with the service
  account privileges that the Pod runs with, thus may lead to privilege escalation. Creating Jobs drains the 
  limited resources available to other Kubernetes workloads. Attaching Persistent Volumes to a Job may expose 
  the data on that volume to attackers.

    notes: >-
      Jobs tie up compute resources in Kubernetes that cannot be allocated to
      another Kubernetes workload while the Job is present. Jobs run a user-specified
      container image, which may allow an attacker to escalate their privileges by running arbitrary
      code inside the Kubernetes workload with service account privileges. Persistent Volumes may be 
      attached to jobs, meaning data can be exposed to the Kubernetes workload.

      - destruction:logs
    notes: >-
      Deleting a Job deletes its pods and ephemeral volumes. Persistent Volumes
      attached to the Job are left intact. Logs of the deleted pods disappear
      permanently when the job completes and the pods shut down, unless they are exported to an external system
      for persistence.

      Describes detailed metadata about the Job, Pods and Containers in it, 
      such as ports, IP address, replicas, attached volumes, containers and the images
      they are running.

      Equivalent to `container.jobs.get`. Allows reading the `/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/deployments/{name}/status`
      subresource which returns the same payload as the `/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/deployments/{name}` resource.

      Allows listing all Jobs in a namespace.

      - exfiltration:data
      - impact:hijack
      - impact:spend
    notes: >-
      An update may suspend the job which prevents the controller from creating Pods, effectively disabling the Job. 
      An update may also let an attacker change the container image that is running inside pods, potentially leading to a arbitrary
      code execution. Secondly, increasing the parallelism in Jobs or the amount of resources dedicated to Pods drains the 
      limited resources available to other Kubernetes workloads. Also, persistent volumes may be attached to the Pods, 
      which may provide access to sensitive data.
  updateStatus:
    vulnerabilities: []
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      Allows updating the status object of the Jobs with different "active", "failed", "ready", and "succeeded"
      counts. However, these values don't take effect, despite a successful API call. The status is managed by Kubernetes.
