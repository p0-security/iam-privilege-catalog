name: Endpoint
description: >-
  A Kubernetes endpoint is a mapping of an IP address and a port to target reference, mostly a Pod.
  The same IP and port may map to multiple Pods to describe a load balancing scheme.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Typically endpoints are not managed directly. Endpoints are a lower-level abstraction managed by a Service object.
  Endpoint slices are a newer addition to Kubernetes, and serve the same purpose as endpoints. However, they slice the
  potentially large Endpoint object into multiple smaller slices for reduced network traffic between nodes when
  pods are updated.

      Creating an endpoint slice may open up access to Pods from the public Internet.

      Deleting an endpoint slice may partially or completely disrupt public access to Kubernetes Pods.

    notes: >-
      An endpoint update allows remapping IP addresses and ports to different Pods.
