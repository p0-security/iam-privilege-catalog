name: Kubernetes Engine Role Bindings
description: >-
  A RoleBinding is used to associate a Role with one or more principals (users, groups, or service accounts). 
  It establishes a connection between a set of permissions defined in a Role and the entities that should have those permissions.
  Roles are scoped to a specific Kubernetes namespace.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Roles are only definitions of permissions. A role does not take effect unless
  assigned to principal via a RoleBinding.

      Kubernetes does not allow the creation or update of a RoleBinding unless at least one of the following two conditions is met:
      1) the caller has the permission it is granting
      2) the caller has the `containers.roles.bind` permission
