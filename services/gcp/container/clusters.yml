name: Kubernetes Engine Clusters
description: >-
  Manages Kubernetes clusters on Google Kubernetes Engine
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  One independent instance of a Kubernetes cluster, consisting of a node-pool and the Kubernetes objects
  such as deployments, statefulsets, pods, jobs that represents workloads and configuration running on
  the cluster, managed by Kubernetes.

  create:
    vulnerabilities:
      - impact:spend
      - impact:hijack
    notes: >-
      Allows creating a new Kubernetes cluster. Also requires access to a Compute Engine service account.
      By default, GKE uses the Compute Engine default service account, and cluster creation fails unless
      the user has the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission to the service account.
  createTagBinding:
    vulnerabilities:
      - impact:access
      - escalation:privilege
    notes: >-
      Attach a tag to a cluster as a key-value pair. Tags can conditionally allow or deny policies.

  delete:
    vulnerabilities:
      - destruction:data
      - destruction:infra
      - destruction:network
    notes: >-
      Deletes a cluster and related resources: control plane resources, nodes, pods, firewalls,
      routes, ephemeral volumes. It will also attempt to delete external and internal load balancers
      created by the cluster, as well as persistent disk volumes.

  deleteTagBinding:
    vulnerabilities:
      - destruction:policy
      - escalation:privilege
    notes: >-
      Tags can conditionally allow or deny IAM policies. Privilege escalation is possible since removing tags may lead to additional IAM bindings matching the principal.
  get:
    vulnerabilities:
      - escalation:privilege
      - impact:access
      - discovery:infra
    notes: >-
      Retrieves cluster information including public and private endpoint IP address,
      and cluster certificate. The information contained allows configuring Kubernetes
      API access to the cluster, similar to the `container.clusters.getCredentials` permission.
    impact: MEDIUM
  getCredentials:
    vulnerabilities:
      - escalation:privilege
      - impact:access
      - discovery:infra
    notes: >-
      Allows configuring Kubernetes API access to the cluster.
      To actually execute any API calls, other `container` permissions are also required.
    impact: MEDIUM
  impersonate:
    vulnerabilities:
      - escalation:lateral
    notes: >-
      This permission is used by the Kubernetes Engine Service Agent role (among others)
      to impersonate a Workload Identity. Thus, it is meant to be used by machine identities,
      workloads running on the Kubernetes cluster that need to access other Google Cloud services.
      Access to this permission leads to lateral movement by allowing human principals to 
      act as Kubernetes workloads.

    vulnerabilities:

    scope: CRITICAL
    notes: >-
      Allows modifying various parameters of the cluster that are critical for the
      healthy functioning and protection of the cluster. In addition, it allows resizing
      the cluster node pool, and upgrading the Kubernetes version.
