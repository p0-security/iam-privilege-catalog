name: Kubernetes Engine Service Accounts
description: >-
  A Kubernetes service account is a machine identity for Kubernetes workloads. 
  It provides an authentication mechanism for applications and processes running within a Kubernetes cluster.
  Service accounts are primarily used to authenticate requests made to the Kubernetes API server.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Each service account has a unique token associated with it, which is used to authenticate requests. 
  This token is automatically mounted as a secret within the container running the workload, and
  workloads (such as Pods) use it to authenticate against the Kubernetes API server.
  The token is a long-lived token, however, it is re-created each time the Pods are re-created.
  Service accounts may also hold an `imagePullSecret` object used to authenticate against
  a container image repository.

    notes: >-
      Creating a service account by itself does not represent a security risk.
      Service accounts need to be granted permissions via Roles.

    risks: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Allows sending a TokenRequest to the API server. This request issues a new token and binds
      the token to a service account. The token is also returned to the caller, allowing it to act as 
      the service account bound to that token.

  delete:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      Deleting a service account may disrupt communication of workloads with the Kubernetes API server.
  get:
    risks: [discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Read which secrets are associated with a specific service account. The secret contents cannot be read
      with this permission.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Read all service accounts in a namespace.
  update:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      An update may remove or add more secrets. In particular, a removal may remove the imagePullSecret of
      service account or the Kubernetes API secret.
