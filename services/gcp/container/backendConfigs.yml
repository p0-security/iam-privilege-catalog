name: BackendConfig custom resource definition for Google Kubernetes Engine
description: >-
  BackendConfig objects are reusable configurations for Kubernetes Service objects.
  BackendConfigs set the destination Service for incoming requests, thus they pertain to external-to-internal communcations. 
  Other ingress parameters of a BackendConfig include service response timeout, Cloud CDN, 
  HTTP access logging, Session Affinity.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Backend Config is a piece of reusable configuration for an Ingress object. 
  A BackendConfig does not take effect unless it is associated with an Ingress object.

    notes: >-
      An attacker may manipulate Ingress settings if they are also allowed to associate
      BackendConfig objects with Ingress objects using container.ingresses.update or container.ingresses.create permissions.

    vulnerabilities: [destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      BackendConfigs that are associated with a Service can be deleted without first removing the reference to them.
      Access to a Service can be disrupted by deleting a BackendConfig that is associated with a Service.
