name: Endpoint Slice
description: >-
  A Kubernetes endpoint slice contains up to 100 mapping entries from an IP address and a port to target reference, mostly a Pod.
  The same IP and port may map to multiple Pods to describe a load balancing scheme.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Typically endpoint slices are not managed directly. Endpoint slices are a lower-level abstraction managed by a Service object.
  Endpoint slices are a newer addition to Kubernetes, and serve the same purpose as endpoints. However, they slice the
  potentially large Endpoint object into multiple smaller slices for reduced network traffic between nodes when
  pods are updated.

      Creating an endpoint may open up access to Pods from the public Internet.

    notes: >-
      Deleting an endpoint may partially or completely disrupt public access to Kubernetes Pods.

    notes: >-
      Retrieve metadata about a specific endpoint: the IP address, port, and target reference, typically a Pod.

    notes: >-
      Retrieve  about all endpoints: the IP address, port, and target reference, typically a Pod.

    notes: >-
      An endpoint update allows remapping IP addresses and ports to different Pods.
