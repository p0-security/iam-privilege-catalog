name: Kubernetes Engine API Services
description: >-
  Exposes /apis/apiregistration.k8s.io/v1/apiservices Kubernetes API endpoints.
  API Services provide a way to advertise a Kubernetes API that is implemented across 
  multiple versions of Kubernetes. It is used to register and expose APIs for Kubernetes 
  extensions and custom resources. It also provides a way to specify the resource schema 
  for a custom resource, which enables client-side validation and discovery of resources.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  API Services can be used to track the availability and health of API servers and extensions 
  in the cluster. For custom resources can set the insecureSkipTLSVerify to true which allows
  unauthenticated communication with the custom resource's endpoints.

    notes: >-
      Together with the ability to deploy a new Kubernetes service in the cluster an attacker
      can configure an APIService to expose that new service with custom authentication settings
      which opens a backdoor to the cluster.
