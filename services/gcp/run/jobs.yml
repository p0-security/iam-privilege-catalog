name: Cloud Run Jobs
description: >-
  A Cloud Run job is used for running code that executes for a period of time and exits once complete.
  Jobs may be executed on a one-off basis, a recurring schedule, or as part of a workflow.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Cloud run jobs may be used for important organizational tasks, such as processing of sensitive data.
privileges:
  create:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Executing a job requires the run permission, so create on its own does not allow execution of the newly created job.
      Cloud Run billing is based on execution of jobs and services, so creation does not incur spend.
  createTagBinding:
    risks: [impact:access, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. The
      risks apply if the tag is used in any policies.
  delete:
    risks: [impact:dos, destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      You can only delete a job if there are no executions in progress.
      However, certain services may rely on a job that runs on a schedule, so 
      deleting a job can create a DOS even if at deletion time there are no executions in progress.

  run:
    risks: [impact:spend, impact:hijack, escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      If combined with create permission and iam.serviceAccounts.actAs on the Cloud Run service account, includes a resource hijacking risk.
  runWithOverrides:
    risks:
      [
        impact:spend,
        impact:hijack,
        impact:manipulation,
        exfiltration:data,
        escalation:lateral,
      ]
    notes: >-
      Allows an attacker to run a job with overrides for the environment variables and arguments.
      Depending on the job and the contents of environment variables and arguments, this may 
      allow the attacker to hijack the job for their own purposes, manipulate organizational data, 
      or store output data in a location accessible to the attacker.
      Also includes a resource hijacking risk if combined with the create permission and iam.serviceAccounts.actAs on the Cloud Run service account.
  setIamPolicy:
    risks: [escalation:privilege, impact:access, destruction:policy]
  update:
    risks:
      [
        impact:spend,
        impact:dos,
        impact:hijack,
        impact:manipulation,
        exfiltration:data,
      ]
    notes: >-
      Allows an attacker to update settings for a job, including CPU/memory limits, timeouts, retries, 
      the values of environment variables, and the container entrypoint command and arguments.
      Depending on the job and the contents of environment variables and arguments, this may 
      allow the attacker to hijack the job for their own purposes, manipulate organizational data, 
      or store output data in a location accessible to the attacker.
      Changing CPU/memory limits or increasing retries can incur spend, and changing timeouts, reducing 
      retries, or manipulating arguments/environment variables can create a DOS.
