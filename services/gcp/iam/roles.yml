name: IAM Roles
description: >-
  IAM custom roles created for use in IAM policies.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  This is a sensitive service since it exposes information about organizational IAM policies and allows for potential manipulation of access.

    risks: [persistence:account]
    notes: >-
      Undeleting a custom role will restore any bindings the role was part of at the time of deletion.
  delete:
    risks: [impact:access, destruction:policy]
    notes: >-
      Deleting a custom role is possible even when it's present in bindings. The bindings remain, but are ineffectual.
  update:
    risks: [escalation:lateral, escalation:privilege, impact:access]
    notes: >-
      Only custom roles can be updated. An update automatically grants additional access for principals to resources 
      that the role is bound to. An attacker is able to grant additional permissions to a role they already have.
      Note that permissions are inherited by child resources. For example, updating role bound to a project can grant
      permissions on new services and new resources.
