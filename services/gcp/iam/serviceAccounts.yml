name: Service Accounts
description: >-
  Service accounts are Google accounts intended for use by applications or workloads for authentication. They can be either managed by Google or user-managed.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Many of these permissions are extremely sensitive, because service accounts are frequently overprovisioned. A user with access to a service account effectively has access to all permissions the service account has, so broad access to service accounts can allow users to gain unintended access.
privileges:

    notes: >-
      By default, the generated access token only persists for an hour. Longer access times (up to 12 hours) can be configured via
      the constraints/iam.allowServiceAccountCredentialLifetimeExtension organization policy.

  implicitDelegation:
    risks: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Implicit delegation allows you to chain service account access token requests. This permission on a service account gives the user access to creating access tokens on any service accounts that service account has access to.

    risks: [escalation:lateral, impact:manipulation]
    notes: >-
      Allows for signing of arbitrarily payloads. Can be used for escalation by signing an access token request.
