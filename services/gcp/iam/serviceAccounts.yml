name: Service Accounts
description: >-
  Service accounts are Google accounts intended for use by applications or workloads for authentication. They can be either managed by Google or user-managed.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Many of these permissions are extremely sensitive, because service accounts are frequently overprovisioned. A user with access to a service account effectively has access to all permissions the service account has, so broad access to service accounts can allow users to gain unintended access.
