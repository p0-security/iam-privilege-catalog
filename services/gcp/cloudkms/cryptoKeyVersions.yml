name: Cloud KMS Crypto Key Versions
description: >-
  A key version contains key material used for encryption or signing.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Cloud KMS is an extremely sensitive service. Keys can be used for encryption/decryption of 
  sensitive data or for the creation or verification of digital signatures.
privileges:
  create:
    risks: [impact:spend]
  destroy:
    risks: [destruction:crypto, impact:encryption]
    notes: >-
      Destroyed key versions cannot be recovered.
      Any data encrypted with the key version will no longer be able to be decrypted.
  get:
    risks: [discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      This includes infra discovery because key metadata such as the algorithm are exposed. Does not give access to keys.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      See get.
  manageRawAesCbcKeys:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      This permission is required to manage AES CBC keys. 
      It has no risks because it provides no access on its own: the user
      still needs permissions on the keys.
  manageRawAesCtrKeys:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      This permission is required to manage AES CTR keys. 
      It has no risks because it provides no access on its own: the user
      still needs permissions on the keys.
  manageRawPKCS1Keys:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      This permission is required to manage AES CTR keys. 
      It has no risks because it provides no access on its own: the user
      still needs permissions on the keys.
  restore:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Restores a key that was scheduled for destruction.
  update:
    risks: [impact:dos, destruction:metadata]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to disable a key version. While a key version is disabled,
      data encrypted with it cannot be accessed. The secret content of the key
      cannot be edited or destroyed via this method.
  useToDecrypt:
    risks: [impact:spend, exfiltration:data]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to decrypt data encrypted with the key version.
  useToDecryptViaDelegation:
    risks: [impact:spend, exfiltration:data]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to decrypt data encrypted with the key version through other Google Services.
  useToEncrypt:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to encrypt data with the key version.
  useToEncryptViaDelegation:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to encrypt data with the key version through other Google Services.
  useToSign:
    risks: [impact:spend, impact:manipulation]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to sign data with the key version.
  useToVerify:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to verify data signed with the key version.
  viewPublicKey:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      This only shows public keys
