      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. If the user has any
      policies that use tag bindings to enforce conditions, creating a tag on a resource allows them
      to escalate their access to that resource. Also requires getIamPolicy or knowledge of the IAM
      policy from some other means.
