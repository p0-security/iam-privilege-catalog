name: Google Cloud SQL
description: >-
  A Cloud SQL instance is a VM managed by Google that runs the SQL database instance (as well as any accompanying containers)
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Cloud SQL is used to store and serve sensitive and application-critical data. Breach of a cloud SQL database can lead to exfiltration of highly sensitive data, or interruption of mission-critical applications.
privileges:
  addServerCa:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Adds a new trusted Certificate Authority version for the specified instance. It does not actually update the existing CA, 
      that requires a separate permission (rotateServerCa), so this poses no risks.

  clone:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Cloning an instance also requires the create privilege.
  connect:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      This command temporarily changes the authorized networks for this instance to allow connections from your IP address.
      Note that authentication into the database is still separate, so this does not provide access to data.

  create:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      This privilege allows users to create new Cloud SQL instances, potentially incurring cost due to resource usage.
  createTagBinding:
    risks: [impact:access, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. If the user has any
      policies that use tag bindings to enforce conditions, creating a tag on a resource allows them
      to escalate their access to that resource. Also requires getIamPolicy or knowledge of the IAM
      policy from some other means.
  delete:
    risks: [destruction:data, destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      With this privilege, users can delete Cloud SQL instances. It poses risks of service disruption, permanent data loss, and infrastructure damage.
  deleteTagBinding:
    risks: [escalation:privilege, destruction:policy, impact:access]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. The "destruction:policy" and
      "impact:access" risks apply if the tag is used in any policies.
  demoteMaster:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows converting an instance to a read replica. Since read replicas do not allow write requests, this
      can cause a denial of service if the instance is handling write requests.

  export:
    risks: [exfiltration:data]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows exporting the results of a SQL query run on the instance database as a CSV, or exporting the entire database as a SQL dump.
  failover:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      This causes Cloud SQL to switch to serving data from a secondary instance instead of the primary.
      Google expects the failover operation to render the instance inaccessible for about 60 seconds, so this could 
      produce a DOS if executed repeatedly.
  get:
    risks: [discovery:infra, discovery:policy]
    notes: >-
      Allows access to instance metadata and settings, including IP addresses, authorized networks, and backup settings.
  getDiskShrinkConfig:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The specific use of this permission is unknown.
  import:
    risks: [impact:consumption, impact:dos, impact:manipulation]
    notes: >-
      Allows importing data to an instance. If enough data is imported to exceed the disk space of the instance, 
      will cause a DOS until the instance is manually resized.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:infra, discovery:policy]
    notes: >-
      Allows access to instance metadata and settings, including IP addresses, authorized networks, and backup settings.
  listEffectiveTags:
    risks: [discovery:policy]
  listServerCas:
    risks: []
  listTagBindings:
    risks: [discovery:policy]
  login:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The specific use of this permission is unknown.
  migrate:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The specific use of this permission is unknown.
  performDiskShrink:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The specific use of this permission is unknown.
  promoteReplica:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows converting a read replica to a primary instance.

  reencrypt:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      This permission re-encrypts the instance with the existing primary key.
  resetReplicaSize:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The specific use of this permission is unknown.
  resetSslConfig:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Deletes all client certificates and generates a new server SSL certificate for the instance.
      This can cause a denial of service since clients will not be updated to use the new certificate.

      - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/resetSslConfig
  restart:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Restarts the instance. This can cause a denial of service since it closes all existing connections.
  restoreBackup:
    risks: [destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    notes: >-
      The restore process overwrites all the current data on the instance and it cannot be recovered.
    links:
      - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/restoring
  rotateServerCa:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Rotates the server certificate to one signed by the certificate authority version previously added. 
      Can cause a denial of service if clients have not been updated to use the new certificate.
      There must be another certificate authority already added to exploit this.

  startReplica:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Starts replication from the primary instance on a read replica.
    links:
      - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/manage-replicas
  stopReplica:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Stops replication from the primary instance on a read replica. Requests are made directly to a replica, 
      so any subsequent requests to that read replica will get outdated data.
    links:
      - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/manage-replicas
  truncateLog:
    risks: [destruction:logs]
    notes: >-
      This allows truncating log entries from the instance.
      Will only pose a risk to logs that are stored as tables in the database,
      which is configured in database settings.
  update:
    risks: [impact:dos, destruction:defense, impact:spend, impact:encryption]
    notes: >-
      Allows updating various instance metadata and settings, including authorized networks, backup settings, 
      and encryption keys.
