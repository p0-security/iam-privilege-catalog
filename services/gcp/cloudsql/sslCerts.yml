  Cloud SQL is used to store and serve sensitive and application-critical data. Breach of a cloud SQL database can lead to exfiltration of highly sensitive data, or interruption of mission-critical applications.
privileges:
  create:
    risks: [impact:consumption, escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows creating a client SSL certificate for the instance, which allows the user to establish a connection to the instance.
      Note that authentication into the database is still separate, so this does not provide access to data.
  createEphemeral:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      This permission allows creating an ephemeral client SSL certificate for the instance, which allows the user to establish a connection to the instance.
      Note that authentication into the database is still separate, so this does not provide access to data.
