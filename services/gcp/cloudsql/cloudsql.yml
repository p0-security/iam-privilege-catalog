    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      This privilege enables users to establish a connection to a Cloud SQL instance. 
      The vulnerability "data discovery" implies the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  
  viewLogs:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      This privilege allows users to view logs and monitoring information for a Cloud SQL instance. 
      The vulnerability "data discovery" implies the risk of unauthorized access to log data 
      containing potentially sensitive information.

  manageSslCerts:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:data, impact:access]
    notes: >-
      Users with this privilege can manage SSL certificates for Cloud SQL instances. 
      The vulnerabilities indicate the potential impact on data integrity and unauthorized access to SSL certificates.

  manageReplication:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, impact:data, impact:infra]
    notes: >-
      This privilege enables users to manage replication settings for a Cloud SQL instance, 
      including configuring replica instances and replication types. The vulnerabilities suggest the risks of privilege escalation, 
      potential impact on data integrity, and infrastructure changes related to replication.
  
  manageBackups:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, impact:data, impact:infra]
    notes: >-
      Users with this privilege can manage backups for Cloud SQL instances, 
      including scheduling backups, configuring retention policies, and managing backup storage. 
      The vulnerabilities suggest the risks of privilege escalation, potential impact on data integrity, and 
      potential infrastructure changes related to backups.
  
  manageInstanceSettings:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, impact:data]
    notes: >-
      With this privilege, users can manage various instance-level settings for a Cloud SQL instance, such as storage capacity, backup options, and maintenance settings. 
      The vulnerabilities indicate the risks of privilege escalation and potential impact on data availability and instance configurations.
