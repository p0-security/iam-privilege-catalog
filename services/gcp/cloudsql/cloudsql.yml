description: >-
  Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed database service that makes it easy to set up, 
  maintain, manage, and administer relational databases.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Cloud SQL provides a secure and scalable solution for storing and accessing relational data in the cloud. It supports various database engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. 
  The CRITICAL scope is assigned to reflect the criticality of the service to the organization's operations and data. Any compromise or disruption to the Cloud SQL instances can have severe impacts on business continuity, data integrity, and overall system availability.

privileges:
  createInstance:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      This privilege allows users to create new Cloud SQL instances. It involves the potential excessive costs due to resource usage.

  deleteInstance:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data, destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      With this privilege, users can delete Cloud SQL instances. It poses the risks of service disruption, permanent data loss, and infrastructure damage.

  createDatabase:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      This privilege enables users to create databases within a Cloud SQL instance. It involves the potential excessive costs due to resource usage.

  deleteDatabase:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data, destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      With this privilege, users can delete databases within a Cloud SQL instance. It poses risks to data integrity and potential impact on the infrastructure.

  deleteUser:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data]
    notes: >-
      Users with this privilege can delete database users within a Cloud SQL instance. It poses risks to data integrity.

  getConnection:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    notes: >-
      This privilege enables users to establish a connection to a Cloud SQL instance. The vulnerability "Data discovery" implies the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

  viewLogs:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    notes: >-
      This privilege allows users to view logs and monitoring information for a Cloud SQL instance. The vulnerability "data discovery" implies the risk of unauthorized access to log data containing potentially sensitive information.

  manageSslCerts:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:account]
    notes: >-
      Users with this privilege can manage SSL certificates for Cloud SQL instances. The vulnerabilities indicate the potential impact on unauthorized access to SSL certificates.

  manageReplication:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      This privilege enables users to manage replication settings for a Cloud SQL instance, including configuring replica instances and replication types. The vulnerabilities suggest the risks of privilege escalation, potential impact on data integrity, and infrastructure changes related to replication.

  manageBackups:
    vulnerabilities: [collection:data, destruction:data, impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Users with this privilege can manage backups for Cloud SQL instances, including scheduling backups, configuring retention policies, and managing backup storage.
