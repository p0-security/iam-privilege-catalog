description: >-
  Every Firestore in Datastore mode query computes its results using one or more indexes which contain entity keys in a sequence 
  specified by the index's properties and, optionally, the entity's ancestors. The indexes are updated to reflect any changes 
  the application makes to its entities, so that the correct results of all queries are available with no further computation needed.

    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      attacker can create too many indexes and hit the index limits.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      attacker can delete indexes and cause queries to execute slow or fail.

  update:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      attacker can update indexes, which can long time to build and cause queries to execute slow or fail.
      indexes also take up storage space which impact spend.
