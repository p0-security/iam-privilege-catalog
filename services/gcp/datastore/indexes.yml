  Cloud Datastore indices enable fast and optimized data queries in Firestore in Datastore mode. 
  However, altering indices can lead to increased costs, longer index build times, operation limitations, 
  and temporary performance impacts. By default, all entity properties are automatically indexed, 
  but creating custom indices incurs storage and operation costs. Deleting indices can negatively 
  impact query performance, and functionality, and require index rebuilding, potentially resulting 
  in slower queries and incomplete results, along with increased costs for index rebuilding.

      An attacker can delete indexes and cause queries to execute slowly or to fail.

    notes: >-
      An attacker can update indexes, which can consume time, or cause queries to execute slowly or to fail.
      Indexes also incur spend.
