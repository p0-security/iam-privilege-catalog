name: Compute Engine packet mirroring
description: >-
  Packet mirroring allows duplication and forwarding of packets on a virtual private cloud.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Packet mirroring allows inspection of network traffic, allowing access to unencrypted network
  data.

    notes: >-
      Consumes mirroring quota and incurs spend proportional to the amount of mirrored network
      data. When combined with a compromised instance (used as the packet collector), allows collection
      of network data.

    risks: [destruction:defense]
    notes:
      Primary packet-mirroring use cases include intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and deep-packet
      inspection (DPI) tools. Disabling packet-mirroring prevents these systems from functioning.

      Can be used to modify which network components are mirrored and how they are filtered, leading to
      either increased network collection or defeated security monitoring.
