name: Compute Engine network endpoint groups
description: >-
  Manage network endpoint groups (NEGs) for Google Cloud load balancers.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Multiple organizational functions may often reside within
  Compute Engine. However, abuse of network-endpoint rules requires
  leveraging additional risks in VM / VPC configuration,
  such as sensitive data or access broadcast on open VPC ports.

    notes: >-
      With a NEG on an already accessible network, can be used to connect
      to sensitive backend services. Can be combined with `create` to broaden
      attack surface.

      When combined with attachNetworkEndpoints, can be used to connect to
      sensitive backend services.

    notes: >-
      In combination with the ability to alter health checks, allows creation of
      health checks based on NEGs. Could lead to DOS if health checks are sufficiently
      frequent, and the referenced endpoints sufficiently expensive.
