name: Compute Engine instance groups
description: >-
  Create and alter (unmanaged) instance groups.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Allows creation, modification, and destruction of manually
  managed instance groups. Generally requires exercise of multiple
  vulnerabilities to exploit.
privileges:
  create:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Instances must be manually added to the group; therefore no
      directly impactful vulnerabilities.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:infra]
  list:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:infra]
  update:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral,destruction:network]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Can provide access to a VM by connecting instances to a compromised
      load-balancing rule; or, remove necessary infrastructure from network
      access.
  use:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      No known or documented application; may be necessary to assign the group
      to a load balancer.
