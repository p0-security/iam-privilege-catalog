name: Compute Engine managed instance groups
description: >-
  Create and alter managed instance groups.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Allows creation, modification, and destruction of
  auto-scaling instance groups. Except for resizing, can not
  critically impact organizational functions.
privileges:
  create:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend, impact:hijack]
    notes: >-
      Can be exploited for cryptojacking purposes, but additionally
      requires creation of corresponding instance templates. Instances
      may be accessible via addition to target groups.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra, destruction:network]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Does not delete instances themselves, but can effectively remove network
      access to instances.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:infra]
  list:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:infra]
  update:
    vulnerabilities:
      - impact:spend
      - destruction:infra
      - destruction:data
      - destruction:network
      - escalation:lateral
    scope: CRITICAL
    notes: >-
      Groups can be resized, either increasing spend or destroying infrastructure.
      Groups can be added to target pools, granting access via unsecured network
      endpoints.
  use:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      No known or documented application; may be necessary to assign the group
      to a load balancer.
