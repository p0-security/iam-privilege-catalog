name: Compute Engine virtual-private-cloud networks
description: >-
  Allows management of virtual-private-cloud networks (VPCs). A VPC is a logically isolated
  network, allowing communication of instances within the network, isolation of instances from
  entities outside the network, and policy-based network controls between instances within the
  network, and entities outside of it.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  VPCs are generally highly sensitive. Alterations to, or destruction of, the VPC can prevent
  instances from serving applications, processing data, and the like. Obtaining access to the VPC
  can allow access to attached instance services. Finally, altering a VPC can allow data to be
  extracted from an otherwise compromised instance.
privileges:
  access:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      The use of this permission within Google Cloud is unknown, although may be related to
      VPC access connectors (see the `vpcaccess` service).
  addPeering:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      Connects two VPCs into one effective network. Allows access to one network when the other
      is already compromised.
  create:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Newly created networks must be connected to resources to be exploitable. A network
      generally incurs cost only when it serves traffic.
  delete:
    risks: [destruction:network]
  get:
    risks: [discovery:network]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Only allows discovery of peered VPC identifiers.
  getEffectiveFirewalls:
    risks: [discovery:policy]
  getRegionEffectiveFirewalls:
    risks: [discovery:policy]
    notes: >-
      No documented use, but may reasonably be assumed to yield similar information as the `getEffectiveFirewalls`
      privilege.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:network]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: See `get`.
  listPeeringRoutes:
    risks: [discovery:network]
  mirror:
    risks:
      - collection:data
      - impact:spend
    notes: >-
      Packet mirroring duplicates packets sent over the VPC and forwards them to another instance. If that instance
      is compromised, can allow direct read access on all network traffic. Since networks are billed by network traffic,
      can also significantly increase cloud spend. Exploitation requires additional compute.packetMirrorings
      permissions.

  removePeering:
    risks: [destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Disconnects two VPCs from each other. Prevents communication between network resources split between the
      disconnected VPCs.
  setFirewallPolicy:
    risks:
      - destruction:policy
      - escalation:network
      - impact:access
      - impact:dos
    notes: >-
      When used to allow additional access, can either allow access to compute network endpoints, or allow
      outbound exfiltration of data from otherwise compromised instances. When used to remove access, can
      prevent service operation or account access.
  switchToCustomMode:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Custom mode VPCs are not automatically created with subnets.
  update:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Can be used to change firewall application order, modify BGP routing mode, or put the VPC in custom mode.
  updatePeering:
    risks:
      - impact:access
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Can be used to alter how routes are shared between VPCs, or prevent IPv6 traffic between VPCs.
  updatePolicy:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      No documented use.
  use:
    risks:
      - escalation:network
    notes: >-
      Likely necessary to add an instance to a VPC. Can gain access to an instance from a compromised network or
      vice-versa.
  useExternalIp:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      No documented use (external IPs are generally attached directly to instances).
