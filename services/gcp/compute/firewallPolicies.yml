    vulnerabilities: [destruction:policy, escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-

      new policy. Allows escalation when the new policy is overly
      permissive, or the attacker additionally can alter the copied
      policy.
  copyRules:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Unknown or undocumented functionality. Likely unused.
  create:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      No direct vulnerabilities, but may increase the severity of
      attacks using other privileges (see addAssociation, cloneRules,
      and move).
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:policy]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      All associations must be removed prior to deletion.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network, discovery:policy]
