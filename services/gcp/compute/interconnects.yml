name: Compute Engine interconnects
description: >-
  Interconnects provide connectivity between Compute Engine infrastructure
  and on-premises systems.
scope: MEDIUM
notes: >-
  Abuse of interconnect resources generally requires the ability to add interconnects as attachments
  to an already compromised system. For more information see compute.interconnectsAttachments.

    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      Interconnects can only be deleted when no attachments use them.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network]
    notes: >-
      Exposes interconnect IP and MAC address.

    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network]
    notes: >-
      Per get.

    scope: LOW
  update:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, escalation:network]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Can be used to enable, disable, or resize attached interconnects. Requires the interconnect
      to be attached.
  use:
    scope: HIGH
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      When combined with the ability to attach the interconnect, allows network escalation.
      When further combined with the ability to create an interconnect, may allow for arbitrary
      connection of the compute VPC to any network.
