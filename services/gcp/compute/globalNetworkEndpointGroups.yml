name: Compute Engine global network endpoint groups
description: >-
  Manage global network endpoint groups (NEGs) for Google Cload load balancers.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Multiple organizational functions may often reside within
  Compute Engine. However, abuse of network-endpoint rules requires
  leveraging additional vulnerabilities in VM / VPC configuration,
  such as sensitive data or access broadcast on open VPC ports.

    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      With a NEG on an already accessible network, can be used to connect
      to sensitive backend services. Can be combined with `create` to broaden
      attack surface.
  create:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      When combined with attachNetworkEndpoints, can be used to connect to
      sensitive backend services.

    notes: >-
      In combination with the ability to alter health checks, sllows creation of
      health checks based on NEGs. Could lead to DOS if health checks are sufficiently
      frequent, and the referenced endpoints sufficiently expensive.
