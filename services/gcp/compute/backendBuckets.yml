name: Compute Engine backend buckets
description: >-
  Cloud Storage buckets that may be referenced by load-balancer
  URL maps, or via Cloud CDN.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Generally used for providing publicly accessible data via a load balancer.
  This scope may depend on the exact configuration of the load balancer (e.g.
  if the load balancer requires certain cookies or auth tokens), and
  whether the load balancer itself is intended to be publicly accessible.
  The scope of read permissions should be downgraded to PUBLIC if only
  publicly accessible data are contained within these buckets.

    vulnerabilities: [privilege:escalation]
    notes: >-
      Allows an attacker to forge signed URLs, potentially gaining access to additional
      data.

    notes: >-
      When combined with the ability to edit URL maps, allows an attacker to point a
      load-balancer URL to a backend bucket.
