name: Compute Engine interconnect attachments
description: >-
  Interconnects provide connectivity between Compute Engine infrastructure
  and on-premises systems.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  This privilege set may allow connection or disconnection of networks between
  multiple critical systems. To abuse creation of interconnects, multiple concurrent
  risks must be exploited, as abusing interconnects require access to a valid
  target on-premise facility, the ability to create interconnects, the ability to attach
  interconnects, and the ability to map interconnects to a compute router VLAN. The full
  set of privileges necessary to connect to a VLAN are: compute.interconnects.create,
  compute.interconnectAttachments.create, compute.interconnectAttachments.get,
  compute.routers.create, compute.routers.get, compute.routers.update.
privileges:
  create:
    risks: [escalation:network, impact:spend]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Additionally requires the privileges described in this component's notes.
  delete:
    risks: [destruction:network]
  get:
    risks: [discovery:network]
    notes: >-
      Exposes router IP addresses and VLAN tags.
  list:
    risks: [discovery:network]
    notes: Per get.
  setLabels:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    scope: LOW
  update:
    risks: [impact:dos, escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to resize or reroute the interconnect.
  use:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      May allow an attachment to be used by an already compromised cloud router.
