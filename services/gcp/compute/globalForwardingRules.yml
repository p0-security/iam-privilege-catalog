name: Compute Engine forwarding rules
description: >-
  Manage layer 4 port forwarding rules within a Google Cloud load
  balancer. Like `forwardingRules`, but for global load balancing.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Multiple organizational functions may often reside within
  Compute Engine. However, abuse of forwarding rules requires
  leveraging additional vulnerabilities in VM / VPC configuration,
  such as sensitive data or access broadcast on open VPC ports.
privileges:
  create:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to directly create a load balancer.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Also can terminate a load balancer.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network, discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Discovers infrastructure when the target is identified by
      resource identifier.
  list:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network, discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Discovers infrastructure when the target is identified by
      resource identifier.
  pscCreate:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to access Google managed services when a VM
      is already compromised.
  pscGet:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:network, discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Discovers infrastructure when the target is identified by
      resource identifier.
  pscDelete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:network]
  pscSetLabels:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Labels are generally low-sensitivity infrastructure.
  pscSetTarget:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to access Google managed services when a VM
      is already compromised.
  pscUpdate:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral, destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Can not be used to change targets. Can be used to access
      Google managed services when the rule already directs traffic
      to a target service and the attacker has access to a particular
      source VM.
  setLabels:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Labels are generally low-sensitivity infrastructure.
  setTargets:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to escalate access when an attacker can reach
      the loadbalancer source endpoint.
  update:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral, destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Can not be used to change targets. Can be used to escalate
      access when the rule already directs traffic to a target system
      and the attacker has access to a particular source endpoint.
