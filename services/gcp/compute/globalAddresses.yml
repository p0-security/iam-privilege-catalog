description: >-
  Manage global addresses used by cloud load balancers.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Limited attack compared to direct VM access; exploitation involves
  also exercising vulnerabilities in load-balancer routing.

      Reserves a global IP address, but does not assign it to any
      infrastructure.
  createInternal:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:consumption]
    notes: >-
      Reserves a global IP address, but does not assign it to any
      infrastructure. Requires access to the internal network
      for exploitation.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:network]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      An address can only be released if it is not in use.

    vulnerabilities: [escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Requires an attacker to also be able to manipulate load-balancer
      routing rules to gain access to any network resource.
