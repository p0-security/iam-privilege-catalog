name: Compute Engine managed instances
description: >-
  Create and alter managed instances.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Allows access to general core VM infrastructure, which can support a broad
  array of organizational functions. Note that the terms "instance" and "VM"
  are interchangeable within the compute engine documentation, although may
  have semantic differences within these privileges.
privileges:
  addAccessConfig:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Allows a public IP address to be assigned to the instance. Further access depends on
      the instance's firewall rules.
  addMaintenancePolicies:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Appears to be unused, or replaced with `setScheduling`.
  addResourcePolicies:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Requires an existing resource policy and `compute.resourcePolicies.use` or
      `compute.resourcePolicies.useReadOnly` on the policy. Resource policies can
      automatically start or stop instances.

    notes: >-
      Creating an instance can export the instance's service account credentials to an external
      server using the VM's local access to the instance metadata (see `get` below). Allows
      access to network instances to which the VM is connected (e.g. VPCs). Created
      instances can be used to hijack resources, or create extra spend.

      - impact:defacement
      - impact:hijack
    notes: >-
      Allows root-level access to the instance, effectively allowing full control of
      all services hosted on the instance. Allows full access to instance metadata,
      similar to vulnerabilities of `get`. Allows access to all data stored on the
      instance. Allows access to bound service accounts, granting access to all resources
      accessible by the service account (potentially including data repositories). Allows
      access to any networks to which the instance is bound. Allows alteration of logs,
      potentially allowing the attacker to conceal their presence. If the instance has a
      service account, additionally requires permission to act as that service account.
  osLogin:
    vulnerabilities:
      - collection:data
      - destruction:data
      - discovery:network
      - discovery:policy
      - escalation:lateral
      - exfiltration:data
      - impact:defacement
      - impact:hijack
    notes: >-
      Specific vulnerabilities depend on the instance configuration, but can include most
      of the vulnerabilities of `osAdminLogin`, subject to privileges granted within the
      instance OS and file systems. If the instance has a service account, additionally
      requires permission to act as that service account. Assuming traditionally root-level
      permissions are unavailable to users that log in via this privilege, alteration of
      services, logs, and networks, as well as metadata exfiltration, may be prevented.
      Compute resources may still be consumed assuming relatively liberal instance user
      limits. Backend services that serve or store data in accessible locations may be
      altered, or their data collected.
  removeMaintenancePolicies:
    vulnerabilities: []
    notes: >-
      Appears to be unused, or replaced with `setScheduling`.
  removeResourcePolicies:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Resource policies can automatically start or stop instances, leading to denial-of-service
      (if instances are no longer started), or additional spend (if instances are no longer
      stopped).

  sendDiagnosticInterrupt:
    vulnerabilities: [collection:data]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Requires additional privileges to exploit: for Linux systems, the ability to configure
      NMI response behavior and to read crash logs; for Windows systems, the ability to read
      the console.

  setDeletionProtection:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra, destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Additionally requires the ability to delete the instance.
  setDiskAutoDelete:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra, destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    notes: >-
      Leads to destruction when the instance is deleted.
  setIamPolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, impact:access, destruction:policy]
  setLabels:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      Used generally for filtering instance lists.
  setMachineResources:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows the replacement of attached GPUs. The machine must be stopped. Could potentially
      lead to a denial-of-service if the instance is restarted and is undersized for its workload.
  setMachineType:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows reconfiguration of the instance machine type. The machine must be stopped. Could potentially
      lead to a denial-of-service if the instance is restarted and is undersized for its workload.
  setMetadata:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      Only allows setting of custom metadata.
  setMinCpuPlatform:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows reconfiguration of the minimum CPU platform (microarchitecture) the instance can use.
      The machine must be stopped. Could potentially interrupt services that require features from a
      specific CPU platform (e.g. a specific number of available threads, vCPUs, or instructions).
  setName:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Can break instance references when instances are referred to by name rather than resource ID.
  setScheduling:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Can lead to data or log destruction when the instance is configured to terminate on host
      maintenance. May be used to prevent crashed hosts from automatically restarting. Requires
      the ability to crash the instance to exploit. Can only be applied to a stopped instance.

  setServiceAccount:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:infra, escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Set a service account removes any existing service account access from the machine, preventing
      any requests to other resources that rely on that account. When the newly attached service account
      is already compromised, can allow lateral escalation to the instance.

    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Can induce spend with arbitrary instances.
  startWithEncryptionKey:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      The specified disk encryption key must be already known.
  stop:
    vulnerabilities: [destruction:data, impact:dos]
  suspend:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Ephemeral machine state is saved on suspend.
  update:
    vulnerabilities:
      - destruction:data
      - destruction:infra
      - destruction:network
      - impact:spend
    notes: >-
      Certain updates can reset the machine. Most sensitive update methods (e.g. adding disks) require
      `.use` permissions on any added resources. However, resources (e.g. disks, network interfaces,
      service accounts) can generally be removed without additional permissions. However, instance
      scheduling and shielded-instance config can be altered without additional permissions.
