name: Compute Engine managed instances
description: >-
  Create and alter managed instances.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Allows access to general core VM infrastructure, which can support a broad
  array of organizational functions. Note that the terms "instance" and "VM"
  are interchangeable within the compute engine documentation, although may
  have semantic differences within these privileges.
privileges:
  addAccessConfig:
    risks: [escalation:privilege]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Allows a public IP address to be assigned to the instance. Further access depends on
      the instance's firewall rules.
  addMaintenancePolicies:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Appears to be unused, or replaced with `setScheduling`.
  addResourcePolicies:
    risks: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Requires an existing resource policy and `compute.resourcePolicies.use` or
      `compute.resourcePolicies.useReadOnly` on the policy. Resource policies can
      automatically start or stop instances.

    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      When combined with `compute.disks.use`, can escalate access to disk data.

    notes: >-
      Creating an instance can export the instance's service account credentials to an external
      server using the VM's local access to the instance metadata, including disk encryption
      keys and short-lived service account tokens. Allows access to network instances to which the VM is
      connected (e.g. VPCs). Created instances can be used to hijack resources, or create extra spend.
      Creating an instance with an attached service account requires permissions to impersonate the service account,
      so access to the service-account token does not present a privilege escalation.

    notes: >-
      Allows access to a wide array of metadata including account public keys, network configuration,
      and service account permissions. Note that, although the Google API documentation suggests that
      access is also granted to secret material such as disk encryption keys or service-account tokens,
      these are not included in the API response returned by the API.

    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Allows reading data from an instance even if exfiltration is otherwise prevented via
      firewall rules / limited console access. Requires an additional exploit to write data
      to the serial port.

    notes: >-
      Allows root-level access to the instance, effectively allowing full control of
      all services hosted on the instance. Allows full access to instance metadata,
      similar to risks of `get`. Allows access to all data stored on the
      instance. Allows access to bound service accounts, granting access to all resources
      accessible by the service account (potentially including data repositories). Allows
      access to any networks to which the instance is bound. Allows alteration of logs,
      potentially allowing the attacker to conceal their presence. If the instance has a
      service account, additionally requires permission to act as that service account.
  osLogin:
    risks:
      - collection:data
      - destruction:data
      - discovery:network
      - discovery:policy
      - escalation:lateral
      - exfiltration:data
      - impact:defacement
      - impact:hijack
    notes: >-
      Specific risks depend on the instance configuration, but can include most
      of the risks of `osAdminLogin`, subject to privileges granted within the
      instance OS and file systems. If the instance has a service account, additionally
      requires permission to act as that service account. Assuming traditionally root-level
      permissions are unavailable to users that log in via this privilege, alteration of
      services, logs, and networks, as well as metadata exfiltration, may be prevented.
      Compute resources may still be consumed assuming relatively liberal instance user
      limits. Backend services that serve or store data in accessible locations may be
      altered, or their data collected.
  removeMaintenancePolicies:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Appears to be unused, or replaced with `setScheduling`.
  removeResourcePolicies:
    risks: [impact:dos, impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Resource policies can automatically start or stop instances, leading to denial-of-service
      (if instances are no longer started), or additional spend (if instances are no longer
      stopped).

  sendDiagnosticInterrupt:
    risks: [collection:data]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Requires additional privileges to exploit: for Linux systems, the ability to configure
      NMI response behavior and to read crash logs; for Windows systems, the ability to read
      the console.

  setDeletionProtection:
    risks: [destruction:infra, destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Additionally requires the ability to delete the instance.
  setDiskAutoDelete:
    risks: [destruction:infra, destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    notes: >-
      Leads to destruction when the instance is deleted.
  setIamPolicy:
    risks: [escalation:privilege, impact:access, destruction:policy]
  setLabels:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      Used generally for filtering instance lists.
  setMachineResources:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows the replacement of attached GPUs. The machine must be stopped. Could potentially
      lead to a denial-of-service if the instance is restarted and is undersized for its workload.
  setMachineType:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows reconfiguration of the instance machine type. The machine must be stopped. Could potentially
      lead to a denial-of-service if the instance is restarted and is undersized for its workload.
  setMetadata:
    risks: [destruction:data]
    scope: LOW
    notes: >-
      Only allows setting of custom metadata.
  setMinCpuPlatform:
    risks: [impact:dos]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Allows reconfiguration of the minimum CPU platform (microarchitecture) the instance can use.
      The machine must be stopped. Could potentially interrupt services that require features from a
      specific CPU platform (e.g. a specific number of available threads, vCPUs, or instructions).
  setName:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Can break instance references when instances are referred to by name rather than resource ID.
  setScheduling:
    risks: [destruction:data, destruction:logs]
    scope: MEDIUM
    notes: >-
      Can lead to data or log destruction when the instance is configured to terminate on host
      maintenance. May be used to prevent crashed hosts from automatically restarting. Requires
      the ability to crash the instance to exploit. Can only be applied to a stopped instance.

  setServiceAccount:
    risks: [destruction:infra, escalation:lateral]
    notes: >-
      Set a service account removes any existing service account access from the machine, preventing
      any requests to other resources that rely on that account. When the newly attached service account
      is already compromised, can allow lateral escalation to the instance.

      Tags are used to control access.
  simulateMaintenanceEvent:
    risks: [destruction:data, destruction:network, impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Executes maintenance events, which can move instances between hosts, preempt jobs,
      or stop or restart instances. Inherits the risks of those actions.
    links:
      - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/simulating-host-maintenance
  start:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      Can induce spend with arbitrary instances.
  startWithEncryptionKey:
    risks: [impact:spend]
    notes: >-
      The specified disk encryption key must be already known.
  stop:
    risks: [destruction:data, impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      Stopping instances with local SSD will delete the disk and result in data loss if the command is issued without the `discard-local-ssd=false`.
      Instances with persistent storage are not impacted.
    mitigations:
      - To prevent data loss, move the data from ephemeral storage to persistent storage.

      Ephemeral machine state is saved on suspend.
  update:
    risks:
      - destruction:data
      - destruction:infra
      - destruction:network
      - impact:spend
    notes: >-
      Certain updates can reset the machine. Most sensitive update methods (e.g. adding disks) require
      `.use` permissions on any added resources. However, resources (e.g. disks, network interfaces,
      service accounts) can generally be removed without additional permissions. However, instance
      scheduling and shielded-instance config can be altered without additional permissions.

  updateAccessConfig:
    risks: [destruction:network, escalation:privilege]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Allows a public IP address to be assigned to or removed from the instance. Further access depends on
      the instance's firewall rules.

      No known risks.
  updateNetworkInterface:
    risks:
      - destruction:network
      - escalation:lateral
      - escalation:privilege
    notes: >-
      Allows alteration of the instance's joined network (for example, the instance can be moved to a different
      VPC), external IP addresses, and DNS records. May allow access to infrastructure on new networks.
      Further access depends on this and other instance's firewall rules.

    risks: []
    notes: >-
      No known usage of this privilege.
  updateShieldedInstanceConfig:
    risks: [destruction:infra, destruction:defense]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to disable secure boot, remove the vTPM from the instance, or disable integrity
      monitoring. Requires the instance to be stopped.
  updateShieldedVmConfig:
    risks: [destruction:infra, destruction:defense]
    notes: >-
      Can be used to disable secure boot, remove the vTPM from the instance, or disable integrity
      monitoring. Requires the instance to be stopped.
  use:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    scope: HIGH
    notes: >-
      Can be used to connect the instance to other components, potentially allowing additional
      access. For example, adding the instance to an instance group can allow the instance's
      network to be accessible.
  useReadOnly:
