  Manage disk images.

notes: >-
  Multiple organizational functions may often reside within
  Compute Engine. Risks generally require exploiting
  multiple privileges.
privileges:
  create:
    risks: [exfiltration:data]
    notes: >-
      When combined with a compromised source, a compromised storage
      bucket, and a known encryption key, can allow an attacker to
      exfiltrate a disk image.
  createTagBinding:
    risks: [impact:access, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      An attacker can exploit tag-based IAM policies to gain access
      to image data.

    risks: [destruction:data]

    risks: [escalation:privilege, destruction:policy, impact:access]

    risks: []
    notes: >-
      No particular impact.
