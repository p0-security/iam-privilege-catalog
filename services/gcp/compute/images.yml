  Multiple organizational functions may often reside within
  Compute Engine. Vulnerabilities generally require exploiting
  multiple privileges.

    vulnerabilities: [exfiltration:data]
    notes: >-
      When combined with a compromised source, a compromised storage
      bucket, and a known encryption key, can allow an attacker to
      exfiltrate a disk image.

    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      An attacker can exploit tag-based IAM policies to gain access
      to image data.
