name: Identity Aware Proxy web types resource type.
description: >-
  Refers to all IAP secured web apps in the project of a particular type.  
  The specified type can either be App Engine or Compute engine.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  IAP is used to control access to cloud services.  Changes to IAP related settings could remove access from mission-critical applications or 
  grant an attacker access to sensitive resources.
privileges:
  getIamPolicy:
    risks: [discovery:policy, discovery:account]
  getSettings:
    risks: [discovery:network]
    notes: >-
      Allows an attacker to read IAP related settings for this resource.
  setIamPolicy:
    risks: [escalation:privilege, impact:access, destruction:policy]
  updateSettings:
    risks: [impact:dos, impact:defacement, impact:hijack, destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Allows an attacker to update settings related to IAP.  There is a risk of dos if an attacker removes
      any settings that are essential for authentication such as which domains are allowed access the app.  
      There is another setting that allows for creation of a custom Access Denied page.  This creates a risk
      of hijack or defacement where an attacker could put up a page of their own.
