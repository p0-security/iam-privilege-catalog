name:  Identity Aware Proxy tunnel destination groups resource type.
description: >-
  Refers to a particular group of VMs in you project.  VMs are collected in a list of either CIDRs or FQDNs.
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  IAP is used to control access to cloud services.  Changes to IAP related settings could remove access from mission-critical applications or 
  grant an attacker access to sensitive resources.
privileges:
  accessViaIAP:
    risks: [impact:dos, escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      Gives a principal access to a particular IAP secured tunnel destination group.  This could create a dos if access is removed.  An attacker could also use this to gain access to a new

  create:
    risks: [escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      Creates a new destination group.  An attacker could exploit this to gain access to new machines.
  delete:
    risks: [impact:dos, destruction:network]
    notes: >-
      Deletes an existing tunnel destination group.  This could create a dos if the deleted item is used by other services since they would no longer have access.
  get:
    risks: [discovery:network, discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Retrieves an existing tunnel destination group.

    risks: [discovery:policy, discovery:account]
  list:
    risks: [discovery:network, discovery:infra]
    notes: >-
      Lists the existing tunnel destination groups.
  remediate:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      If granted this permission, a principal will be allowed to remediate a failed authentication attempt.  The steps to remediate can be
      customized per resource and consist of steps like asking users to update their operating system or to use the application from a 
      company run network.

  update:
    risks: [impact:dos, destruction:network, escalation:network]
    notes: >-
      Updates an existing tunnel destination group.  This could create a dos if an attacker deletes items from the group.  
      It could also allow an attacker to gain access to machines by adding them to a group they have permission for.
