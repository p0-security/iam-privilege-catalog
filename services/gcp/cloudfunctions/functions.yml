      Function metadata includes the following: 
        - labels and descriptions associated with the function
        - build config (docker registry/repository, source code location, build-time env variables)
        - service deployment config (memory info, env variables available during execution, network traffic settings: ingress for function, egress for VPC connector, secret volume and env variable configuration)
        - configuration for events that trigger the function (service info for the service that triggers the info, filters on event fields)
        - encryption key name

      Allows execution of a cloud function.
      Can expose a variety of risks depending on the contents of the cloud function.
      Also allows for DOS via spamming executions and data injection via execution with fake parameters.
