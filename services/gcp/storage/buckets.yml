name: Cloud Storage buckets
description: >-
  Buckets are the basic unit of data storage within Cloud Storage. All data must be contained in a bucket.
scope: CRITICAL
notes: >-
  Buckets may be used to store data of various sensitivities, from publicly available data to very sensitive confidential data.
privileges:
  create:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:spend]
    scope: LOW
  createTagBinding:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:access, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. If the user has any
      policies that use tag bindings to enforce conditions, creating a tag on a resource allows them
      to escalate their access to that resource. Also requires getIamPolicy or knowledge of the IAM
      policy from some other means.
  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos, destruction:data, destruction:infra]
  deleteTagBinding:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, destruction:policy, impact:access]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. The "destruction:policy" and
      "impact:access" vulnerabilities apply if the tag is used in any policies.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    scope: LOW
  list:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    scope: MEDIUM
  getIamPolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:policy, discovery:account]
  listEffectiveTags:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:policy]
    scope: LOW
  listTagBindings:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:policy]
    scope: LOW
  setIamPolicy:
    vulnerabilities: [escalation:privilege, impact:access, destruction:policy]
  update:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:encryption, destruction:metadata]
    notes: >-
      Even though certain access-related controls are part of the bucket metadata (ACLs, public access
      settings), those cannot be updated without setIamPolicy. However, the encryption key can be updated
      with just this permission. An attacker could use their own key (in their own project) to encrypt
      the data, then disable or delete it, rendering the data unusable until the user can recover the key.
  getObjectInsights:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:data]
    notes: >-
      This includes access to object metadata, but not objects themselves.
