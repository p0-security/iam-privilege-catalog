name: Cloud domains registration
description: >-
  A registration is a resource representing a domain registration managed by Cloud Domains. 
  It facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations
scope: HIGH
notes: >-
  Though the contents of domain registrations are public, this resource contains many permissions
  to update and configure domain registrations which are highly sensitive.
privileges:
  configureContact:
    risks: []
    notes: >-
      Only allows updating a registration's contact settings.
  configureDns:
    risks: [impact:dos, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      Allows updating DNS settings, including specifying custom name servers. 
      Allows an attacker to route traffic on the domain.
  configureManagement:
    risks: [destruction:infra, takeover:domain]
    notes: >-
      Allows updating domain settings, such as 
      renewal settings and whether the domain is locked from being transferred to another registrar.
      Also allows exporting the domain so that it is no longer managed by Cloud Domains (it is still
      accessible through Google Domains).
      Additionally allows retrieving the authorization code for transferring the domain to another registrar.
      These permissions combined can allow an attacker to gain control over the domain by transferring it 
      to another registrar.
  create:
    risks: [impact:spend]
  createTagBinding:
    risks: [impact:access, escalation:privilege]
    notes: >-
      A common use case of tag bindings is for use in IAM policy conditions. The
      risks apply if the tag is used in any policies.
  delete:
    risks: [destruction:infra]
    notes: >-
      If an active domain registration is deleted, the domain can still be managed through Google Domains
      until its expiry. This just deletes the domain's managed registration in Cloud Domains.
