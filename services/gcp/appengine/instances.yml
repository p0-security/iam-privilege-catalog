name: Google App Engine Instances
description: >-
  An instance is the computing unit that fully hosts an App Engine application.
  An application may be running on one or more instances, with scaling and request routing managed by Google.
scope: CRITICAL

  delete:
    vulnerabilities: [impact:dos]
    notes: >-
      App Engine will recreate the instance based on the scaling settings for the app, 
      but repeated deletions could still cause a DOS since in-flight requests may be dropped on deletion 
      (the app has 30 seconds to finish processing in-flight requests.)

    vulnerabilities:
      - collection:data
      - discovery:network
      - discovery:policy
      - escalation:lateral
      - exfiltration:data
      - impact:defacement
      - impact:hijack
    notes: >-
      Allows the user to SSH into the VM where the instance lives. 
      Specific vulnerabilities depend on instance and application configuration (and may require additional permissions based on configuration), 
      but can potentially allow data exfiltration from the application or defacement of the application.
      There are no destruction vulnerabilities since instances are intended to be short-lived (deleted/created according to demand)
      and do not store data intended to be persistent.
  get:
    vulnerabilities: [discovery:infra, discovery:network]
    notes: >-
      This only exposes basic information about the VM it is running on (ID, zone, IP, etc) and application metrics (requests, errors, memory usage, etc)
