name: Google App Engine Memcache
description: >-
  Memcache is a key-value store accessible to App Engine applications.
notes: >-
  Memcache is not intended for persistent storage. Values can expire anytime, so users are recommended
  to only use memcache for values that the application can behave acceptably without. Examples of data 
  commonly stored in memcache are session data and user preferences, as well as results of commonly used datastore queries.
  Scope is HIGH because this service may include sensitive customer data from cached datastore queries used by the application.

    notes: >-
      This removes all key-value pairs from the cache, but it does not cause destruction since
      values may expire anytime and applications need to design around that.
      Repeated flushes may result in a DoS.

      The difference between getKey and get is not clear in Google's documentation.

    notes: >-
      Destruction is not a concern since memcache is only intended for temporary storage.
